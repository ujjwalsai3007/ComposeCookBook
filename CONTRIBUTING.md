# Compose Cookbook - Reference Library

Thank you for your interest in the Compose Cookbook! This repository serves as a **comprehensive reference library** for Material 3 Jetpack Compose components.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This is a **curated reference collection** designed to help Android developers find production-ready Material 3 component implementations. The repository is maintained as a high-quality resource for the developer community.

## How to Use This Repository

### For Developers

This repository is designed as a **reference and learning resource**:

1. **Browse Components** - Explore the 125+ Material 3 components
2. **Copy Code** - Use the production-ready implementations in your projects  
3. **Learn Patterns** - Study the architecture and best practices
4. **Reference Documentation** - Use as a comprehensive Material 3 guide

### Repository Purpose

This is a **curated reference library** maintained to provide:
- **High-quality component examples**
- **Production-ready code patterns**  
- **Material 3 implementation guidance**
- **Architecture best practices**

## Technical Information

### Development Environment

This repository is built with:
- **Android Studio** Arctic Fox or newer
- **Kotlin** 2.0.21 with Jetpack Compose
- **Material 3** design system implementation
- **Modern Android architecture** patterns

### Project Structure

The codebase follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, making it an excellent reference for professional Android development.

## Component Architecture

### Design Patterns Used

All components in this library follow consistent patterns:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ComponentExample(
    // Required parameters first
    text: String,
    // Optional parameters with defaults
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    enabled: Boolean = true,
    // Callbacks last
    onClick: () -> Unit = {}
) {
    // Clean, production-ready implementation
}
```

### Quality Standards

Every component meets these standards:
- **Material 3 compliant** - Following latest design guidelines
- **Accessibility ready** - Proper semantic descriptions and touch targets
- **Performance optimized** - Efficient recomposition and state management
- **Preview enabled** - `@Preview` annotations for easy visualization
- **Documentation included** - Clear usage examples and KDoc comments
